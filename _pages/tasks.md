For a detailed description of the tasks and data, please refer to the [HIPE-2022 Participation Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6045662) and check the [HIPE-2022-data repository](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/blob/main/README.md).



## Tasks
**Task 1: Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)**

  - Subtask 1.1 - 'NERC-Coarse': recognition and classification of entity mentions according to coarse-grained types (task proposed for all languages and datasets). 
  - Subtask 1.2 - 'NERC-Fine': recognition and classification of entity mentions according to fine-grained types (cf. column 2 in Table 2), plus the detection and classification of nested entities of depth 1 (task proposed for English, French and German for some datasets).

**Task 2 : Named Entity Linking (EL)**    

Linking of NE mentions to a unique referent in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or to a NIL node if the mention does not have a referent in the KB. The entity linking task includes two settings: with (EL only) and without (end-to-end EL) prior knowledge of mention boundaries.


## Data

HIPE-2022 data consists of **six primary NE-annotated datasets assembled and prepared for the shared task**. Primary datasets originate from several European cultural heritage projects, from HIPE organizersâ€™ previous research project, and from the previous HIPE-2020 campaign. Some are already published, others are released for the first time for HIPE-2022.

Primary datasets are composed of historical newspapers and classical commentaries covering ca. 200 years; they feature several languages and were annotated with different entity tag sets and according to different annotation guidelines. 

HIPE-2022 team assembles and prepares these primary datasets in **HIPE-2022 release(s)**, which correspond to a single package composed of neatly structured and homogeneously formatted files. Primary datasets undergo the following preparation steps:

- conversion to the HIPE format (with correction of data inconsistencies and metadata consolidation);
- rearrangement or composition of train and dev splits.


Below is an overview table, check the **generic HIPE-2022-data [README](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/blob/main/README.md)** for more information on format, tagging scheme and mapping, as well as the participation guidelines.

<!-- 

- *Subtask 1.1 - NERC Coarse-grained*: this task includes the recognition and classification of entity mentions according to coarse-grained types (Person, Location, Organisation and Product).
- *Subtask 1.2 - NERC Fine-grained*: this task includes the recognition and classification of entity mentions according to fine-grained types (cf. column 2 in Table 2), plus the detection and classification of nested entities of depth 1, as well as entity mention components.

**Task 2 : Named Entity Linking (EL)**

This task includes the linking of named entity mentions to a unique referent in a knowledge base (KB) or to a NIL node if the mention does not have a referent in the KB. The chosen KB is [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org). 


The entity linking task includes two settings: with and without prior knowledge of mention boundaries. Concretely speaking, the [evaluation period](dates.html) will consist of two consecutive rounds, where a first NEL task without prior information on mentions will be evaluated during round 1 (i.e. task bundles 1 and 2), and a second one with information on mention boundaries (but no type) during the second round (bundle 5).
