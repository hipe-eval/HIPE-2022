Sample data will be available by 1 December 2021.


## Objectives of HIPE 2022
  - Assess and advance the development of **robust, adaptable and transferable** named entity processing systems.  
 - Deal with **challenging historical material**, thereby supporting information extraction and text understanding of cultural heritage data.

## Challenges of HIPE 2022
  - multilingual corpora from different countries: English, German (AU,DE,CH) ,French (CH,FR), Finnish, Swedish
  - noisy OCR
  - partial coverage of KBs with respect to historical entities
  - different document types (historical newspapers and classic commentaries)
  - different annotation tagsets 

## Tasks
**Task 1: Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)**
  - Subtask 1.1: 'NERC Essentials': recognition and classification of high-level entity types (all languages) 
  - Subtask 1.2: 'NERC fine-grained' for a subset of languages 

**Task 2 : Named Entity Linking (EL)**
Linking of NE mentions to a unique referent in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or to a NIL node    if the mention does not have a referent in the KB. The entity linking task includes two settings: with and without prior knowledge of mention boundaries.

<!-- 

- *Subtask 1.1 - NERC Coarse-grained*: this task includes the recognition and classification of entity mentions according to coarse-grained types (Person, Location, Organisation and Product).
- *Subtask 1.2 - NERC Fine-grained*: this task includes the recognition and classification of entity mentions according to fine-grained types (cf. column 2 in Table 2), plus the detection and classification of nested entities of depth 1, as well as entity mention components.

**Task 2 : Named Entity Linking (EL)**

This task includes the linking of named entity mentions to a unique referent in a knowledge base (KB) or to a NIL node if the mention does not have a referent in the KB. The chosen KB is [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org). 


The entity linking task includes two settings: with and without prior knowledge of mention boundaries. Concretely speaking, the [evaluation period](dates.html) will consist of two consecutive rounds, where a first NEL task without prior information on mentions will be evaluated during round 1 (i.e. task bundles 1 and 2), and a second one with information on mention boundaries (but no type) during the second round (bundle 5).
