## Working Note Paper Instructions


As with all CLEF 2022 Labs, HIPE-2022 Working Note papers will be published in the [CEUR-WS.org](http://ceur-ws.org/) proceedings.

Complete instructions for authors are now posted on the [CLEF-20222 website](https://clef2022.clef-initiative.eu/index.php?page=Pages/instructions_for_authors.html), and we highlight the main points below.

#### About

Working note papers are technical reports written in English which describe your system and the conducted experiments. They should provide, at least, the following information:

* Title, Authors, Affiliations, Email addresses of all authors.  
	* Body of text. This should contain information on:  
	* tasks performed  
	* main objectives of experiments  
	* approach(es) used and progress beyond baselines or state-of-the-art  
	* resources employed  
	* results obtained. Please report on test sets, and if suitable also on dev sets.  The organizer's overview paper will focus on the best run per team. Your system paper might report on your individual runs in more detail.
	* analysis and discussion of the results  
	* perspectives for future work
* In order to support replicability, we encourage you - whenever possible - to publish:
	* your code on a public repository with associated license
	* any additional resource you might have used.

Bibliographic references for the datasets, the HIPE-2022 introduction, and previous HIPE 2020 publications can be found here: [https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data#references](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data#references). 

For an example of Working Note papers, see e.g. the [HIPE-2020 papers](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2696/).


#### Formatting
The papers must be formatted according to http://127.0.0.1:4000/HIPE-2022/ available at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1atq0bC9hSDMicqm79Jeu6TWOR-q_BCRQ?usp=sharing), either using Word or Latex one column templates. These templates are pre-filled with the copyright box with the appropriate information about CLEF 2022.

http://127.0.0.1:4000/HIPE-2022/: no upper page limit is set, as papers are published only electronically, but experience teaches that overwhelmingly long papers are not effective. We would expect something between 6 to 10 pages (excluding references).

####  Submission
Submission of papers is to be done electronically at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clef2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clef2022).     
When submitting, select the HIPE track; in case you participated in both NERC and EL tasks, just select one (no matter which).


The metadata of easychair submission will be used for preparing final Working Notes. Please pay attention to insert correct information at submission time in easychair. All the data inserted in Easychair should match exactly the data in the PDF of the paper (correct and complete author names, authors listed in the correct order, and a correct paper title). 

#### Copyright form

The copyright form can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pqwL_1zdANJsKqSRUx5_EIouQpEkHake/view?usp=sharing).
Please note that it is mandatory to print the form, sign it by hand, and upload a scan of the signed physical copyright form.
