### About

Following the first CLEF-HIPE-2020 evaluation lab on historical newspapers in three languages, HIPE-2022 is based on diverse datasets and aims at confronting systems with the challenges of dealing with more languages, 
learning domain-specific entities, and adapting to diverse annotation tag sets.    

The **objectives** of HIPE-2022 are to:

 - assess and advance the development of **robust, adaptable and transferable** named entity processing systems across languages, time periods, document types, and annotation tag sets.  
 - deal with **challenging historical material**, thereby supporting information extraction and text understanding of cultural heritage data.

 
Compared to the first edition, HIPE-2022 introduces **several noveltie**s, with:

- the addition of a **new type of document** alongside historical newspapers, namely classical commentaries;
- the consideration of a **broader language spectrum**, with 5 languages for historical newspapers and 3 for classical commentaries;
- the confrontation with the issue of the **heterogeneity of annotation tag sets and guideline**s.


Therefore the main **challenges** of the HIPE-2022 edition are:

  - multilingual corpora from different countries: English, German (AU,DE,CH) ,French (CH,FR), Finnish, Swedish
  - different document types (historical newspapers and classic commentaries)
  - noisy OCR
  - partial coverage of KBs with respect to historical entities
  - different annotation tagsets
