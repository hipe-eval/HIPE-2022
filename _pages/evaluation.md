## Format of datasets and submission
We will offer all datasets in a simple tab-separated verticalized textual format (CoNLL-like) using an IOB tagging scheme. 
See [HIPE 2020 datasets](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020/tree/master/data) for an example. Submissions are required to provide the results in the same data format.

## Evaluation metrics and scorer
The performance of systems will be evaluated in terms of Precision, Recall and F-measure. The [HIPE 2020 scorer](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020-scorer) will be used again.
